# VisionV2
Vision is an open source and advanced anticheat for 1.8.9 Minecraft Java Edition servers.

## What version of Bukkit do I need to run this?
This is made for 1.8.8 spigot servers.

## What makes this stand out against other anticheats?
### Open Source
This anticheat is fully open source, meaning there is almost no chance of getting anything malicious on your computer. It also ensures you can make forks of this anticheat.

### (Mostly) Packet Based
Vision uses packet interception for most checks. By doing this, we can make sure no players on your server modifies them.

## More coming soon...
